        "description_heading_price_br": "$650 / 2000ft2 - $650 - Bdrm avail in fabulous, beautiful, spacious 9 rm home# (Davis/Teele Somerville), , 650, This is a 9 room,  5 bedroom/5 person house. It is a spacious,  sunny space with original woodwork throughout. It has a fully-equipped eat-in kitchen with a 6 burner + 2 oven gas stove,  dishwasher and walk-in pantry for extra food storage. The living & dining rooms open into each other creating a great space for relaxing with a book or sipping wine with friends. It also is great for quirky art projects and watching movies. Two,  4 season enclosed porches,  one large with bright morning sun and the other a cozy nook. Both double as comfortable,  private bedrooms for our out-of-town guests. Two updated full baths (one contemporary and one traditional) with good water pressure that never runs cold. An ultra-modern gas boiler (for heat and hot water) and a high efficiency central air conditioning system. Large basement is dry with a high ceiling,  it has a front load washer and a dryer,  a storage area(but no room to store furniture). Indoor bike parking,  a small yard (just big enough for a bbq and 6 friends,  plenty of on-street parking if your car has a Somerville parking permit.We've lived in the apartment a long time so it really feels homey. Nice colors,  lots of plants,  paintings,  assorted other art work,  Persian rugs,  hardwood floors and comfy leather sofas. It's a beautiful,  friendly place that's always comfortable even when the streets are buried in snow or sweltering in heat and humidity.We are located in Teele Square a short 10 min walk to Davis T with several bus lines passing by the house and the bike path is just down the street. An even shorter walk to the local grocery store and lots of restaurants,  pubs,  convenience stores,  dry cleaners...We are looking for 1 male or female housemate. The available bedroom is on the 3rd floor,  12' x 11',  with 2 windows facing south and 1 closet.Room is available for Sept move in. We are looking for a 1 year commitment.Presently we are 2 men and 2 women,  who are creative,  independent and open-minded. The house is friendly and the vibe light and familial. Each of us either works full-time. We are generally cheerful and easy going and like people who are the same. We have numerous other creative past-times and pleasures as well,  including making home cooked meals for housemates and friends,  ethnic food,  earthy red wine,  single malts,  Vermont cheese,  homemade pies,  listening to local music,  fabricating gizmos,  exploring the city,  imbibing craft brews at local pubs,  foreign travel,  speaking lots of languages,  going to museums,  grungy cafes,  movies with subtitles and a motley batch of delightful things. At home,  we prefer a more quiet space for conversation and occasional shared dinners. We prefer to take our partying elsewhere but enjoy having friends over for dinner from time to time and we always have room for out of town visitors.We are looking for mature,  responsible housemates to join our warm home. We work to keep the house clean,  and need you to be open to sharing household responsibilities,  such as cleaning,  taking out the trash,  and must pay bills on time. We need you to be a very good and open communicator,  and to be respectful of everyone's needs. No \u00fcber-defensive folks,  no passive-aggression. We tell it how it is around here,  and you need to be of the same ilk. No TV addicts or having a live-in boyfriend/girlfriend tag along with you.We think you especially rock if you are some/all of the following; do-gooder,  love to cook,  baker,  brewer,  well-read,  intellectual,  curious,  internationally well-traveled,  musician,  scientist,  artist,  polyglot and not a chooch.Utilities average about 80 dollars a month per person (electricity,  broadband internet,  wi-fi,  heat,  ac,  cable TV) Move in requires first and last month's rent,  plus a security deposit equal to one month's rent,  a total of $1950,  no exceptions. Sadly neither pets nor smokers are allowed,  double no exceptions. We will not agree on having you as a housemate unless we meet in person,  triple no exceptions. (Skype is not in person).If you're interested please send us an email. Tell us enough about yourself so we'll have a good idea that together we would constitute a mutually comfortable home.",
